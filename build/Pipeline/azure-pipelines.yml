                ## What's New
                
                For a full list of closed issues since last release, see below. 
                
                ## How to install / use
                
                Download one of the items from the `Assets` section below. If in doubt, I would
                recommend using the self-contained installer.

                There are two types of downloads available:

                - **Binaries:** These are just a `.zip` file ready to be extracted, with no
                  installation necessary. No entry will be created in the control panel's program
                  list
                - **Installers:** A typical self-extracting installer which will require admin
                  rights
                
                For each of those download types, there are two variants:

                - **.NET:** This requires at least version 6.0 of the
                  [.NET Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/current/runtime)
                  installed (the one for desktop apps is enough)
                - **Self-contained .NET:** For these, the .NET runtime is included with the
                  installation, so you won't need to install anything else. As a drawback, the
                  resulting tool is much larger in file size
                  
                **Starting from version 2.0, .NET Framework is no longer supported. For more
                information, see #188.**
